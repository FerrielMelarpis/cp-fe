#### Issues
- /mock-api
  - add step to run `npm build` before `npm run start`

#### Notes
##### Create new client feature
Further Improvements
- Validation can be further improved.
  - Might be better to use a tested library like [zod](https://zod.dev/)
- Form handling can be further improved.
  - Either create a `useForm` hook to facilitate handling of form values and submission.
  - or use a tested library like [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
